## About Me

<h4>I'm a Software Engineer with 7+ years of experience. I have a passion for building high-quality, user-friendly applications. I have a strong background in frontend development, with expertise in TypeScript, React, and Redux. I am always looking to learn new technologies and improve my skills!</h4>

In 2008, I received a Bachelor of Arts in Screenwriting from Loyola Marymount's School of Film and Television. I worked in the entertainment industry for several years, before discovering my true passion for software development. In 2014, I enrolled in a coding bootcamp and quickly fell in love with programming. Since then, I have worked as a software engineer at several companies, building web applications and honing my skills.

Throughout my career, I have worked on a wide range of teams, from small startups to larger corporations. I particularly enjoy working with product managers and product designers to collaborate on the roadmap for our products, communicating with our users to understand their needs, and executing features with my fellow engineers.

## Some Favorite Technologies

In no particular order, here are some of my favorite libraries that I've worked on over the course of my career:

- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/): A powerful end-to-end testing library that allows you to write tests for your web applications in a variety of browsers. This is my end-to-end testing library of choice! I cannot fathom the amount of **days** it has saved me in debugging time.
- [MSW](https://mswjs.io/): A powerful library for mocking API requests in your tests. This is an invaluable tool for quickly mocking success/failure responses from any API endpoint, which makes it very easy to test your components in isolation.
- [Deck.gl](https://deck.gl/) / [React-map-gl](https://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/) / [Mapbox-gl-js](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides): These libraries are fantastic for building interactive maps in React. I relied on these libraries daily in my last role, where I built a mapping application for a large client.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): Prettier is a code formatter that I use in all of my projects. I shudder to think of the days that this library didn't exist üò≥.
- [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/): A fantastic charting library that I used extensively at my very first job. I had a lot of fun using this to build informative, interactive charts for our users.
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/): Storybook is a fantastic tool for building UI components in isolation. Not only does it make it easy to build and iterate on components in isolation, it can also be a great tool for documenting your components.

## Coming Soon - Hydrogen Stations Map

(03/22/24) - I'm currently working on a new personal project - a web application that will render a map of all the hydrogen stations in California, and their current status. I'll be using Next.js, Redux, and Mapbox-gl-js to build this application.

I currently live in Los Angeles, and have a lease on a hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle. The infrastructure for hydrogen fueling stations is still quite lacking, and even amongst the stations that exist in the Los Angeles area, they are often either out of fuel, or offline altogether. A similar web application does currently exist ([Hydrogen Stations Map](https://h2fcp.org/stationmap)), but as a frequent user of it, there are improvements I'd like to make on it.
